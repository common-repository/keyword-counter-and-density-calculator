		<h3>FAQ</h3>
		<h4>Is this plugin SEO Friendly?</h4>
			<p>Not only are we SEO Friendly -- but that's the whole point of the plugin!</p>
			<p>Most people who write articles online use the keywords too much or too little. It's hard to get it just right. We help you find just the right amount of times to use each keyword!</p>
		<h4>How do you calculate the SEO friendliness?</h4>
			<p>Ah, ha! That's part of our secret sauce. Taking into account different variables: the number of times a keyword appears, looking at the total number of words (with and without the small words), we give you a green/yellow/red light to let you know if you're over-using or under-using your keyword.</p>
		<h4>What do you mean by "small words"?</h4>
			<p>Google often ignores words like "if", "and", "but" in its analyses. So, if you've used a word 5 times out of 150 words -- that's a different picture than if you've used a word 5 times out of 150 words, of which only 70 are not small words! It's important to look at both.</p>
		<h4>What are the default small words you use?</h4>
			<p>Glad you asked. Here are the ones we use by default:</p>
			<p>in,the,at,by,of,for,to,a,an,have,had,their,there,my,your,his,her,it,its,its,too,that,both,is,was,are,were,i,you,he,she,him,we,they,us,more,here,other,another,and,this,these,those,any,some,but,be,not,do,dont,with,as,so,im,into,on,or,while,during,what,where,who,when,why,from,up,if,than,before,after,about,has,our,will,am,been,then,me,also,even,all,can,may,most,such,within,between,among,amongst,himself,herself,itself,themselves,theirselves,which,them,nor,toward,towards,could,always,anything,everything,like,out,would,now,only,almost,should,yet,often,shall,upon,own,till,thus,therefore,let,each,will,no,already</p>
			<p>Let us know if you think we forgot any.</p>
		<h4>What is stemming?</h4>
			<p>Stemming is one of the most useful features. Lets say you want to know how many times you used the word "walk" in a post. But sometimes you say "walk", sometimes "walks", sometimes "walked", sometimes "walking." Stemming is when we guess at what the root word is (in this case, "walk") and we count all instances of the different conjugated versions to be the same as the core root.</p>
		<h4>How accurate is your stemming?</h4>
			<p>Our keyword stemming isn't 100% accurate because that would require us creating a dictionary of millions of words and what conjugated versions map to what roots -- that's only a few ten thousand hours of work!! Instead, we wrote some artificial intelligence that guesses at the root, with strong predictive abilities. Our stems are 95% accurate, on average, we've found. For keyword purposes, this is good enough. Sometimes, it will result in a root word that doesn't actually exist -- but you'll be able to figure out which word it means!</p>
		<h4>Why might I want to use a keyword with more than one word?</h4>
			<p>One of our options is to have a phrase be treated as a keyword. Why is this useful? Glad you asked! Basically, sometimes, for SEO purposes, you're optimizing for a keyword that isn't actually just a single English-language word, but instead a "phrase." It should probably be called a "keyphrase" to be less confusing. Google takes into account, very substantially, keywords that are phrases. So, lets say, you want to optimize for the phrase "WordPress security" and you want to see how often you use that phrase. By default, the plugin would count "WordPress" and "security" as two separate words. This option lets you treat them as one, united phrase.</p>
